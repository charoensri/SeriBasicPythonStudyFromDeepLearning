**Pluto's Surprising Geological Activity**  
In icy realms where cold winds blow,  
A heart of mountains, a world aglow.  
With craters deep and plains so bright,  
Pluto dances in the cosmic night.  

**Future Observations with Subaru Telescope**  
Through Subaru’s gaze, the stars align,  
New wonders beckon, a celestial sign.  
With lenses sharp, the dark we’ll unveil,  
In the vast expanse, our dreams set sail.
