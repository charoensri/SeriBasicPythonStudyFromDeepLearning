      "Common Data and Integration Designer\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "The Data and Integration Designer, also called Designer case, uses a case-based approach\n",
      "for extending the data model, automating workflows for adding new entities and properties,\n",
      "adding relationships, and integrating with external sources. The Designer case has the\n",
      "following stages:\n",
      "1. Create – used to create new entities.\n",
      "2. Extend the model – Helps in understanding the existing model and to add fields\n",
      "and modify views.\n",
      "3. Manage relationships – use to create a new relationship between any two\n",
      "entities or extend the existing relationships.\n",
      "4. Manage integration – Helps with connecting to external systems.\n",
      "5. Review configuration – Helps in mapping the fields for integrations.\n",
      "6. Manage sample data – Helps with managing sample data for entities and\n",
      "relationships.\n",
      "7. Test entity – Test the entity data pages and their profiles.\n",
      "When you create a new entity using the Designer case, the following rules are automatically\n",
      "created:\n",
      "CLASS: Entity and all connector related classes are generated\n",
      "CONNECT REST: Connect rest rule with the name of the entity is generated for the\n",
      "new entity\n",
      "DATA PAGES: Two Data Pages are generated for the entity: one page mode and one\n",
      "list mode\n",
      "SECTION: Different types of sections such as the entity header, content, and other\n",
      "display-related sections are generated\n",
      "HARNESS: A harness for each section is generated\n",
      "ACTIVITY: Activity for the processing of each type method of connector such as GET,\n",
      "POST, and PUT\n",
      "DATA TRANSFORM: All the request and response Data transforms for different\n",
      "connector methods are generated. Search-related Data transforms are also\n",
      "generated\n",
      "PROPERTY: Entity class ID and class name properties are generated\n",
      "WHEN rule: When rules for different profiles of Data Page conditions are created\n",
      "SERVICE REST: Service rest rules for the entity are created\n",
      "LOCALIZATION: rules\n",
      "VIEW: rules\n",
      "Using a Designer case, Connect Rest rules can be created for external integration, thereby\n",
      "allowing you to add new connectors to Data Pages and test the entity within the Designer\n",
      "case. You can map these connectors to existing Data Pages and select the appropriate\n",
      "profile for mapping.\n",
      "Prerequisites for using Common application\n",
      "Whenever a new implementation application is created, there are certain configurations to\n",
      "be performed before Common app is ready to be used. These configurations are automated\n",
      "in release 25.1 when the configuration called Implementation automation under Common-\n",
      "General Settings is set to true. In any other cases, for example if implementation automation\n",
      "is set to false, or if the release is prior to 25.1 i.e., 24.2, these should be manually created.\n",
      "• Create the DCR toggle. Navigate to Configure-->System-->Release-->Toggles and\n",
      "create a new one with your application extension suffix (for example CDM_UPlus)\n",
      "and enable this toggle.\n",
      "• Create a new Authentication profile. Records-->Security-->Authentication profile—>\n",

      "extension suffix in this decision table (Use the same name as the toggle)\n",
      "• DetermineApplicationTag_Ext for application tag\n",
      "• Extension data transforms for DCR – ClassSettings, GeneralSettings,\n",

      "Installing the Designer case:\n",
      "The Common Data and Integration Designer case will be shipped as part of the Pega\n",
      "Common Application starting from release 25.\n",
      "If you are on a version earlier than release 25 or wish to use the latest updates of the\n",
      "Common Data and Integration Designer case, follow these steps:\n",
      "1. In the header of Dev Studio, click Application > Definition.\n",
      "2. On the Edit Application page, in the Enabled components section, click Manage\n",
      "components.\n",
      "3. On the Pega Marketplace page, click Browse apps & components, and search for\n",
      "Common Data and Integration Designer.\n",
      "4. Download the latest version of the component.\n",
      "5. In Dev Studio, on the Pega Marketplace page, click Install new, and select the\n",
      "downloaded file from your Downloads folder.\n",
      "6. In the Status column, next to the Common Data and Integration Designer\n",
      "component, click Enabled, then click OK.\n",
      "7. Click Close.\n",
      "8. Save the application rule to apply the changes.\n",
      "Prerequisites for using the Designer case:\n",
      "Before getting started using the Designer case, the following checks and configurations\n",
      "must be performed. Note that this is a one-time configuration and need not be performed\n",
      "every time the designer is run.\n",
      "1. Create the entity class that the Designer case will automatically create new entities\n",
      "into. By default, the entity class will be shipped as “Common-LDM-Entity”. If you\n",
      "wish to create the entities within this class, this step can be skipped. If an org-\n",
      "specific class is to be used, then create a new class having the directed inheritance\n",
      "to Common-LDM-Entity. For example, if the entity class is “TFL-UplusINS-Entity”, it\n",
      "should be inherited from Common-LDM-Entity.\n",
      "a. The class type should be concrete.\n",
      "b. The class inheritance should be pointed to “Common-LDM-Entity”.\n",
      "c. Ensure that the entity class is merged into a ruleset. It should not be\n",
      "present in a branch.\n",
      "d. When the class is created, a history class will be autogenerated. If the\n",
      "history class was not autogenerated, manually create a new history class\n",
      "and inherit it to “History-Common-LDM-Entity\". For example, if the history\n",
      "class is “History- TFL-UplusINS-Entity”, it should be inherited from\n",
      "“History-Common-LDM-Entity\"\n",
      "2. A service package is a data instance for a collection of REST services. Specify the\n",
      "appropriate service package that is present in the application. All the REST services\n",
      "the Designer case generates are stored under this service package. If a service\n",
      "package is not already present in the application, create a new one.\n",
      "a. Records→ Integration-Resources→ Service package\n",
      "b. Provide the access group and change the Authentication type to OAuth\n",
      "2.0 and save the rule.\n",
      "3. Optional: Create a test ruleset if it doesn’t already exist. Having a test ruleset\n",
      "ensures that the rules needed to enable sample data generation are autogenerated\n",
      "using the Designer case. If a test ruleset is not provided, the rules required to create\n",
      "sample data should be manually created by the user. Sample data rules are\n",
      "currently only supported if the entity class is “Common-LDM-Entity”.\n",
      "a. Create a new test ruleset “UplusINSTest” and ensure that the check box\n",
      "to store test cases is enabled and saved (verify this under category tab of\n",
      "the ruleset). Lock the ruleset.\n",
      "b. Add the ruleset to the application ruleset stack and save the app rule.\n",
      "4. Ensure that all the rulesets are locked in the application.\n",
      "5. Ensure that the integration class in application rule is not empty, this class will be\n",
      "used to generate all the required integration assets. Click the Cases & data tab on\n",
      "the application rule to check this.\n",
      "6. Add configuration values for the Designer case. In the navigation pane of App\n",
      "Studio, click Settings → Configurations →Configuration set: Common – Designer\n",
      "Settings.\n",
      "NOTE – The configuration values for this application will be saved as an instance\n",
      "under Data-Configuration-Setting\n",
      "a. Data ruleset – Specify the primary Ruleset of the application. All the core\n",
      "rules that are generated through the Designer case are stored in this\n",
      "primary Ruleset.\n",
      "b. Integration ruleset – Specify the integration ruleset of the application, All\n",
      "the integration- layer rules and integration classes rules that are\n",
      "generated through the Designer case (which are used for External\n",
      "SOR/Local SOR integrations) are stored in the integration ruleset.\n",
      "c. Service package – A service package is a data instance for a collection of\n",
      "REST services. Specify the appropriate service package that is present in\n",
      "the application. All the REST services generated through the Designer\n",
      "case are stored under this service package.\n",
      "d. Entity class – Provide the name of the entity class that the Designer case\n",
      "will automatically create new entities into.\n",
      "e. (Optional) Test ruleset – Provide the name of the test ruleset where all the\n",
      "rules for sample data for the entity and relationship will be created. This\n",
      "step is optional. Sample data rules are currently only supported if the\n",
      "entity class is “Common-LDM-Entity”.\n",
      "8. Log off and log in to the application to pick up the configuration changes.\n",
      "9. Enable branch development, click on the toggle for enabling branch development\n",
      "and create a new branch.\n",
      "Note: It is recommended to use an empty branch for easier maintenance and to\n",
      "avoid any other issues.\n",
      "Designer landing page\n",
      "Navigate to the Designer landing page through App Studio → Tools → Data and Integration\n",
      "Designer, where you will find an option to launch the Designer case. Additionally, you can\n",
      "explore the data model and view the list of Designer cases in the DID Worklist.\n",
      "Understand the data model\n",
      "This feature allows users to explore existing entities by viewing their properties and related\n",
      "information. Users can also test an entity’s data pages and integrations.\n",
      "Designer worklist (DID worklist)\n",
      "This is a list of all Designer cases, which you can open and resume from where you previously\n",
      "left off.\n",
      "Using the Designer case:\n",
      "Note – before beginning, ensure that branch development is enabled.\n",
      "Navigate to App studio→ Tools→ Data & Integration Designer → Launch Designer Tool.\n",
      "Create stage\n",
      "After launching the Designer case, choose from one of the 3 options:\n",
      "1. Create a new entity – used for creating new entities in the application\n",
      "2. Inherit from existing entity - used for creating entities that inherit from available\n",
      "entity classes in the application.\n",
      "3. Reuse from existing entity – used for selecting existing entities and performing other\n",
      "actions like adding fields, managing integrations, creating relationships, etc.\n",
      "Create a new entity\n",
      "When a new entity is created using the Designer case, all the essential rules will be\n",
      "automatically created. The class rule, List and savable data pages, connector rules, service\n",
      "REST rules, data transforms, default views, database table, etc.\n",
      "As an example, if Manufacturer is a new entity being created in the UPlusINS application\n",
      "and the entity class provided was TFL-UplusINS-Entity, then the new entity created would\n",
      "be “TFL-UplusINS-Entity-Manufacturer”.\n",
      "Steps:\n",
      "1. From the 3 options, select Create a new entity\n",
      "2. Provide the new Entity name, a Description and an Entity abbreviation to be\n",
      "used when creating relations, data transforms, etc.\n",
      "3. Then click Create.\n",
      "Once all the rules have been generated, it displays a success modal listing the types of\n",
      "rules generated.\n",
      "4. Click on Submit to proceed to the next steps which are creating the properties,\n",
      "editing views, managing integrations and relations, etc.\n",
      "To verify the rules generated, open the branch in Dev Studio and check for the details.\n",
      "Inherit from existing entity\n",
      "Inheriting from an existing entity inherits the capabilities of the parent entity. When\n",
      "inheriting, you can choose to either use the same name as the parent entity or use a\n",
      "different name.\n",
      "Inherit using the same name\n",
      "When an entity is inherited from an existing entity using the same name, all the capabilities\n",
      "of the parent entity can be leveraged.\n",
      "A new entity class is created and the data pages and other essential rules from the parent\n",
      "class are saved into the new entity class. However, the integrations and services will not\n",
      "be newly created, rather the parent entity’s rules are reused.\n",
      "Steps:\n",
      "1. From the 3 options, select Inherit from existing entity\n",
      "2. In the dropdown to Inherit from, choose the entity to inherit. Note that the entity\n",
      "name will be auto populated and should not be changed.\n",
      "3. Provide the new Description for this entity\n",
      "4. Then click Create.\n",
      "Once all the rules have been generated, it displays a success modal listing the types\n",
      "of rules generated.\n",
      "Note: All the properties from the parent class will be included in the new entity and\n",
      "they can be reused.\n",
      "5. Click on Submit to proceed to the next steps which are creating the properties,\n",
      "editing views, managing integrations and relations, etc.\n",
      "To verify the rules generated, open the branch in Dev Studio and check for the details.\n",
      "For example, if creating a new Contact entity that inherits from Common’s Contact entity\n",

      "critical decision that affects whether a connector can be reused across\n",
      "different applications.\n",
      "➢ If a connector is specific to a single application, it should be created in\n",
      "the Application Integration layer. This ensures it remains tightly coupled\n",
      "with the application it supports.\n",
      "➢ On the other hand, if the connector is intended for use across multiple\n",
      "systems or business units, it should be placed in the Organization\n",
      "Integration layer or\n",
      "➢ Another option is to use a modular and reusable integration layer. For\n",

      "Overview  \n",
      "The Data and Integration Designer, also called Designer case, uses a case -based approach \n",
      "for extending the data model, automating workflows for adding new entities and properties, \n",
      "adding relationships, and integrating with external sources.  The Designer case has the \n",
      "following stages:  \n",
      "1. Create – used to create new entities .  \n",
      "2. Extend the model  – Helps in understanding the existing model and to add fields \n",
      "and modify views.  \n",
      "3. Manage relationships  – use to create a new relationship between any two \n",
      "entities or extend the existing relationships.  \n",
      "4. Manage integration  – Helps with connecting to external systems.  \n",
      "5. Review configuration  – Helps in mapping the fields for integrations.  \n",
      "6. Manage sample data  – Helps with managing sample data for entities and \n",
      "relationships.  \n",
      "7. Test entity  – Test the entity data pages and their profiles.  \n",
      "When you create a new entity using the Designer  case, the following rules are automatically \n",
      "created:  \n",
      "CLASS: Entity and all connector related classes are generated  \n",
      "CONNECT REST : Connect rest rule with the name of the entity is generated for the \n",
      "new entity  \n",
      "DATA PAGES : Two Data Pages are generated for the entity: one page mode and one \n",
      "list mode  \n",
      "SECTION : Different types of sections such as the entity header, content, and other \n",
      "display-related sections are generated  \n",
      "HARNESS : A harness for each section is generated  \n",
      "ACTIVITY : Activity for the processing of each type method of connector such as GET, \n",
      "POST, and PUT  \n",
      "DATA TRANSFORM : All the request and response Data transforms for different \n",
      "connector methods are generated. Search -related Data transforms are also \n",
      "generated  \n",
      "PROPERTY : Entity class ID and class name properties are generated  \n",
      "WHEN rule : When rules for different profiles of Data Page conditions are created  \n",
      "SERVICE REST : Service rest rules for the entity are created  \n",
      "LOCALIZATION : rules  \n",
      "VIEW:  rules  \n",
      "Using a Designer case, Connect Rest rules can be created for external integration, thereby \n",
      "allowing you to add new connectors to Data Pages and test the entity within the Designer \n",
      "case. You can map these connectors to existing Data Pages and select the app ropriate \n",
      "profile for mapping.  \n",
      "Prerequisites for using Common application  \n",
      "Whenever a new implementation application is created, there are certain configurations to \n",
      "be performed before Common app is ready to be used. These configurations are auto mated \n",
      "in release 25.1 when the configuration called Implementation automation under Common -\n",
      "General Settings is set to true. In any other cases,  for example if implementation automation \n",
      "is set to false, or if the release is prior to 25.1 i.e., 24.2,  these should be manually created.  \n",
      "• Create the DCR toggle.  Navigate to Configure -->System-->Release -->Toggles and \n",
      "create a new one with your application extension suffix  (for example CDM_UPlu s) \n",
      "and enable this toggle.  \n",
      "• Create a new Authentication profile . Records -->Security -->Authentication profile —> \n",

      "Prerequisite s for using the De signer case:  \n",
      "Before getting started using the Designer case, the following checks and configurations \n",
      "must be performed. Note that this is a one -time configuration and need not be performed \n",
      "every time the designer is run.  \n",
      "1. Create the entity class that the Designer case will automatically create new entities \n",
      "into. By default, the entity class will be shipped as “ Common -LDM-Entity”. If you \n",
      "wish to create the entities with in this class, this step can be skipped. If an org -\n",
      "specific class is to be used, then create a new class  having the directed inheritance \n",
      "to Common -LDM-Entity. For example, if the entity class is “TFL-UplusINS -Entity”, it \n",
      "should be inherited from Common -LDM-Entity.   \n",
      "a. The class type should be concrete.  \n",
      "b. The class inheritance should be pointed to “Common -LDM-Entity”.  \n",
      "c. Ensure that the entity class is merged into a ruleset. It should not be \n",
      "present in a branch.   \n",
      "d. When the class is created, a history class will be autogenerated. If the \n",
      "history class was not autogenerated, manually create a new history class \n",
      "and inherit it to “History -Common -LDM-Entity\".  For example, if the history \n",
      "class is “History - TFL-UplusINS -Entity”, it should be inherited from \n",
      "“History-Common -LDM-Entity\"  \n",
      "  \n",
